### General properties of the game ###


# Only one value accepted
# String that identifies the set of games defined in this file
simulation_name : Sim7

# All the following properties in this file have 3 different possible assigment configuration:
# immediate number, ex: price_cpu: 0.5
# explicit list of values assigment, ex: price_cpu: [0.5,06]
# implicit list of values assigment, with the format [Initial_val:Final_val:amount_values], ex, cpu_price: [0.5:1:5]

# Max amount of cores hosted at the Edge
max_cores_hosted: 44000
# price per resource unit dollars/millicores
cpu_price: [0.05]
# Investment period, it can take fractions as value
years: [3]
# Amount of time slots in a day, used to calculate load and utilit functions
daily_timeslots: [96]

    #load_function:
    sigma: [500] # standard deviation for calculating the load, 0 will make the load function deterministic
    avg_load: [48530] # average load also referred  as a0
    # hyperparameters: used to define the load function, a_k determining the amplitude (requests) and t_k the offset (time in seconds)
